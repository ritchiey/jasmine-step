# Jasmine-Step

<!--[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linemanjs/lineman-lib-template.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linemanjs/lineman-lib-template)-->

Adds a `Step` command to your Jasmine specs to help you create highly
readable Jasmine or Jasmine-Given specs.

## Humblest Apologies

I was hoping to have this building and passing its specs by now but I've
been a little overwhelmed with other things and I haven't done it.

If you want to see this in action and have a play with it,
you can see my [original implementation](http://www.spechero.com/items/77) of it passing its spec on my
SpecHero site. Feel free to fork it on SpecHero and have a play.

## Help Wanted

This is my attempt to turn that code into a useable library.
Unfortunately, that's not as simple as I'd hoped because I lack
expertise in Javascript tooling (Grunt, Lineman, etc).

I hope to come back to this when I have said expertise but if anyone
wants to help out in the meantime, please feel free to fork this and see
if you can get it working.
